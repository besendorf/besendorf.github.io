# About me
Since almost 10 years I learn about and work in IT security. I study computer science with a focus on IT security and currently work in the [Digital Security Lab](https://rsf.org/en/digital-security-lab) at Reporters without Borders.
For me it's always a joyful activity when sharing my knowledge with others. For example during [crypto partyies](https://cryptoparty.in) or in security workshops with activists and journalists. Besides my job at Reporters without Borders I work as a freelance IT security trainer. 

# Security Training
Passwords, 2-Factor Authentication, Phishing, encryption,... whether you need a basic beginner training or a training a special topic, I offer trainings according to your needs. Please reach out via email to discuss the details.

# IT security check-up
Are you concerned about digital attacks but unsure how good your security measures are? I will do an assessment of your current infrastructure and processes and suggest improvement measures.
